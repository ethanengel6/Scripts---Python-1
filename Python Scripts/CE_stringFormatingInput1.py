# Write a function that takes no parameters and prompts the user to enter their full name (in one go). Enforce the correct format for names, i.e. all letters must be lower case except the first. There is a built-in function that can do this for you :)

# Then prompt the user to enter their age, verify that it is a valid age, i.e. a positive integer. If their input is not a valid age then prompt the user to enter it again.

# Then print out the information that the user entered using .format() method (using indices, keywords, and in order). 

# Ask the user if the information is correct. If the user enters "Yes", "yes", "y", "yeah", "yup" or any other variance of yes (think of what do all of these answers have in common. How can you treat them all in the same way without a ton of if-elif statements ?) then it terminates, othewise it  should prompt the user to re-enter their information and should re-do everything we did previously, including printing to the console the information and prompting the user if they wish to re-enter their information.
