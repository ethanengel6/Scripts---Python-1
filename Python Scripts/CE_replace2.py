# 1)
# Create a function that replaces every instance of a number with a string
# Function takes 3 parameters : list of objects, number to be replaced and the string to replace it with.


# 2)
# Create a function that replaces k elements of a list with some value x
# starting at the index of every value val. Return the modified list.
# Function takes 4 parameters : k, number of elements to replace, and val, the value at which we start replacing values, the replacement value and a list

# values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 5, 7, 9, 2]
# val = 2
# k = 3
# rpl = "Hey"
# Should get : [1, "Hey", "Hey", "Hey", 5, "Hey", "Hey", "Hey", 9, "Hey"]


# 3)
# Create a function that multiplies the contents of a list by a given factor and returns the modified list.
# Function takes 2 parameters : l, list of elements, and k, factor by which
# every element is in the list is multiplied by.


# 4)
# Print out contents of a list in "rainbow order", i.e. start in the middle then print an element to the right, then the element to the left of the first, then the element to the right of the second and so on.... Consider a list with an
# odd number of elements (simplifies the problem).
# Code the general case for brownie points
# Ex : some_list = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
# output ---> 4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 1, 8, 0
