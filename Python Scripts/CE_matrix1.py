#List of lists :
# Create a function that takes in 2 integers, number of rows and number of columns, and returns a matrix with increasing values along the rows and columns.
# Hint: a matrix can be interpreted as a collection of lists
# Use list comprehension for brownie points !

# Note: the matrix being built does not have to be a square matrix and this
# matrix in particular contains the multiplication tables for numbers 1 thru
# nRow

# 0 1 2

# 1 2 3 #0
# 4 5 6 #1
# 7 8 9 #2
 








# Create a function (takes no parameters) that will prompt the user to create
# their user profile for an application. It needs to ask the user to input
# their :
# First/Last name, Birthday/Birthplace, Favorite books (2 books), Favorite
# movies (2 movies), Hobbies (2 hobbies)
# All of these fields should be kept in lists within a list

# Ex :
# user = [[first_name, last_name], [birthday,birthplace], [favorite_books]....]
