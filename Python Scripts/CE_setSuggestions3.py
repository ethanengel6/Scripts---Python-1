# Matching algorithm with friend or date, with the closest taste in music :
# Write a function that takes in a list with 5 elements (the list can have more or less but in this case it'll be 5), whose elements are sets containing artists, and returns the number of similar artists they have in common and their positions in the list (which we will assume is the person's ID for simplicity) of the two people that have the most artists in common.

# Possible artists :
# "The Postal Service", "The Killers", "Regina Spektor", "Two Feet", "Nine Inch Nails", "Brock Berrigan", "David August", "OTR", "Ford", "Yoste", "Manchester Orchestra"

# "Regina Spektor", "Two Feet", "Nine Inch Nails", "Brock Berrigan", "David August", "OTR", "Ford", "Yoste"

# "Augustana", "Wolf Alice", "Max Frost", "Michael Jackson", "The Jackson 5"

# "Electric Guest", "Twenty One Pilots", "Regina Spektor", "Two Feet", "Nine Inch Nails", "Augustana", "Wolf Alice"













# Artist suggestion algorithm :
# Write a function that takes in a list, whose elements are sets containing artists, and a user ID (position in the list) and returns the artists not contained in your own music library of the person that has the most artists in common with you.
