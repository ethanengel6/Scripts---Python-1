# Persona Non Grata checklist :

#personaNonGrata : "Tom", "Susan", "George", "Mat", "Dan", "Dave", "Rudy"
#VIP : "Jess", "Tom", "Tony", "Scott", "Peter", "Rudy", "John", "Lenni"

# Create a function eliminate (in the sense remove from the set, nothing else) the free upgrade eligible (VIPs) passengers that are also in the personaNonGrata watchlist from the VIP set.








# Write a function that takes in 3 arguments : 
# 2 sets containing strings, personaNonGrata watchlist and the updated VIP passangers, string : passanger name

# the function that takes in both sets and a passenger name and checks if the passenger is in the watchlist, VIP or neither and prints a message accordingly.
