# Merging music library from old MP3 player to you new phone's music app :
# Write a function that given 2 lists of artists, it combines them into a single set. Don't want to have multiple instances of Michael Jackson. 




# Create another function that takes a set as an argument, that will prompt the user which artist they wish to add to their music collection. The function should check if the artist is already in their music library or not and print a message accordingly. You can use the output from the previous function as your starting music library.
