# Create a function that creates a tuple containing tuples (takes in no
# arguments) and returns a tuple of tuples: (no need for user input but you may get user input if you want)
# (first name, last name) <- tuple with 2 entries
# (phone numbers) <- this should be a list containing a person's phone number
# within a tuple and you can make the phone number a string
# (home_address) <- tuple with a single entry

# Create one such tuple with tuples for :
# John Smith
# (123)-456-7890
# 123 A St. Town, St

# Print the result

# Add to the tuple of tuples another tuple which contains his age

# Add another tuple containing his email address between his phone number and
# his address

# You will now need to update the phone number to add the home phone number :
# (098)-765-4321

# Print the updated information for John Smith
